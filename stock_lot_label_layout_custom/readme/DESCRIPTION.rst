This module adds new custom report for lot label report.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

The default label print template in Odoo for Lot/Serial Numbers is set to 4 x 12 dimensions.
However, in certain situations, the barcode produced by this template can be too small,
causing inconvenience for warehouse staff when scanning.
This module is specifically designed to address this issue by increasing the barcode size and
configuring it to generate one barcode per page, thereby improving operational efficiency for warehouse staff.
